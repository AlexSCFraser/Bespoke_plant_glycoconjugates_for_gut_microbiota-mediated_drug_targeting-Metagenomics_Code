## Metagenomics Code

This repository contains code and scripts used to perform the metagenomics analysis and subsequent figure rendering 
used in the paper entitled 'Bespoke plant glycoconjugates for gut microbiota-mediated drug targeting'. This code is 
licenced under the MIT licence, a permissive licence, with the goal of encouraging reuse by the scientific community.

Describe any scripts, code, or notebooks (e.g., R, Python, Mathematica, MatLab) as well as the software versions (including loaded packages) that you used to run those files. If your repository contains more than one file whose relationship to other scripts is not obvious, provide information about the workflow that you used to run those scripts and notebooks.

## Archival data for 'Bespoke plant glycoconjugates for gut microbiota-mediated drug targeting'

Todo: add link below once we have it

[Data for this paper is in an archival dataset on Dryad](Dataset DOI link)

The data used in conjunction with these scripts to generate figures used in the paper is not included in this repository because it is licenced to the public 
domain and archived permanently on Dryad.
